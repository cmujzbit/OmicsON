# cutoff <- 0.3

#
# # clusterWithCutoff() is a function for similarity clustering with a cutoff. It takes previously created fingerprints for
# # every molecule and it does the clustering by using Tanimoto method on these fingerprints with the cutoff set on 0.3 (on default) which
# # means that every molecule that after clustering mentioned above has score under 0.3 won't be a part of this cluster.
# # This function keeps on repeating until there is no more molecules that are not clustered (AllIds is empty, counter = 0).
# # Below are the steps which make up this function and they are as follows:
# # 1. Creating empty list (cluster) where created clusters will be stored, each cluster as different component of this list,
# # for example cluster[1] will give us IDs of molecules in cluster number one, custer[2] in cluster number 2 etc.
# # Calling "cluster" after running this function will provide user with list of created clusters.
# # 2. While loop is used with value of the counter as condtion.  If the value of the counter (which is number of rows of
# # AllIds data frame) is greater than zero then loop is executed. It keeps on repeating until counter = 0
# # which means there are no more molecules to be clustered and loop is stopped.
# # 3. Inside while loop takes place an actual clustering. As mentioned before clustering is done by using method
# # based on Tanimoto index on previously created fingerprints with a set cutoff (by default it's 0.3 ).
# # It takes the first molecule (from the first row) from AllIds data frame, using its fingerprint and compare it
# # to the rest of molecules' fingerprints that are still in AllIds data frame. Results of that action
# #  are stored in 'a' object as IDs of clustered molecules.
# # 4. Creating data frame called 'b' from object 'a'.  This new data frame consist of one column called ID and
# # as as much rows as there are molecules clustered this time.
# # 5. Next step is comparing two data frames: 'AllIds' and 'b' (with clustered molecules) and checking which molecules are
# # present in both data frames - these will get FALSE flag and molecules present in only one of these data frames will get
# # TRUE flag. These results (FALSEs and TRUEs) are stored in 'del' object.
# # 6. Next step is updating of AllIds data frame by deleting these molecules that have FALSE flag in 'del' object
# # (becuse they are already clustered). Now in 'AllIds' data frame will be only these molecules
# # which are still not clustered.
# # 7.Updating of 'counter' because now 'AllIds' has less rows than before. When 'counter' reaches
# # zero (when there will be no molecules in AllIds left) while loop won't be excetuted.
# # 8. Updating of 'cluster' which is a list. Each new cluster will be added as a next, new component of
# # this list. Length of this list will be equal to the numbers of created clusters.
# # This function takes as an argument fpset (object with molecules' fingerprints) created earlier.
# # This function will cluster all molecules but one molecule can be found in only one cluster because
# # if the molecule is already clustered then it's removed from pool of molecules still waiting to be clustered.

# # makeSimilarityMatrix() is a function that creates a matrix with similarity values between any two molecules stored
# # in AllIds2 data frame (which is created from "sdfset" object and is identical to Allids data frame).
# # Like clusterWithCutoff function this one does the clustering by using Tanimoto method on molecules' fingerprints
# # but without cutoff (cutoff is set to 0.0). Thanks to that as a result we get similarity matrix with
# # n-rows and n-columns (square) where n is a number of molecules, so there isn't a pair of molecules that don't
# # have similarity value calculated. Similarity between the two identical molecules are equal to 1 and makes
# # the diagonal of this matrix.
# # This function keeps on repeating until there is no more molecules that are not have their similarity
# # with other molecules computed (AllIds is empty, counter = 0).
# # Below are the steps which make up this function and they are as follows:
# # 1. Creating empty matrix (values) where created data frames will be stored, one data frame per molecule,
# # data frame fo every molecule. The numbers of rows and columns are the same as number of molecules.
# # Each new data frame with the computed values between given molecule and the rest of molecules (and between
# # molecule identical to the one given too) will become a new column in created matrix. So every new data frame
# # will be added to the mtarix as new column.
# # 2. While loop is used with value of the counter2 as condtion. If the value of the counter2 (which is number of rows of
# # AllIds2 data frame) is greater than zero then loop is executed. It keeps on repeating until counter = 0
# # which means there are no more molecules which have not been compared with the others.
# # 3. Inside while loop takes place an actual silimarity computing and matrix creating. As mentioned before clustering is
# # done by using method based on Tanimoto index on previously created fingerprints without a cutoff (cutoff = 0.0).
# # This time cutoff  must be equal to 0 and can't be changed because otherwise we won't get full similarity
# # matrix (between any two molecules).
# # It takes the first molecule (from the first row) from AllIds2 data frame, using its fingerprint and compare it
# # to the rest of molecules' fingerprints and to itself too. Results of that action which are similarity scores for
# # any pair of molecules  are stored in 'd' object.
# # 4. Setting molecules' IDs as columns names.
# # 4. Updating AllIds2 data frame by changing the first molecule, so the next molecule will be new number
# # one in this data frame.
# # 5.Updating of 'counter2' because now 'AllIds2' has less rows than before. When 'counter2' reaches
# # zero (when there will be no molecules in AllIds2 left) while loop won't be excetuted.
# # 6. Creating a new object "n" wich is equal to the number of rows in created matrix. It is necessary to do
# # because it will be used as condition in later if/else loop.
# # 7. If/else loop where if n == 1 then one new column will be added to the created, still empty matrix.
# # It will be done only once at the beginning because after adding new column "n" won't be equal to 1 any longer.
# # Then else will be executed where function "cbind" is used - it binds new data frame as new column to the
# # already existing matrix.
